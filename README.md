# ORIGIN #
This project is an exercise done as part of an OpenClassrooms training course for developers in the Python language.
It corresponds to project 10 of the training.

# GOAL OF THE PROJECT 10 #
Project 10 aims to deploy Project 8 on a blank Ubuntu server.

# GOAL OF THE APPLICATION #
This application makes it possible to choose a food for which one wishes to obtain a better quality substitute, in order to improve one's diet. It's based on the Open Food Facts database. It's a free and collaborative database referencing food products from all over the world.

The Open Food Facts website (FR): https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/

# GUIDELINES #
* Use continuous integration (we choose Travis here)
* Perform a console line deployment.
* Use Sentry to read all logs and NewRelic to monitor the application.
* Create a Cron task that will update the items retrieved from Open Food Facts once a week.
* Buy a domain name and link it to the server (optional).
* Code written entirely in English: functions, variables, comments, etc.
* Use an agile project methodology to work in project mode.
