# ORIGIN #
This project is an exercise done as part of an OpenClassrooms training course for developers in the Python language.
It corresponds to project 10 of the training.

# GOAL OF THE PROJECT 10 #
Project 10 aims to deploy Project 8 on a blank Ubuntu server.

# GOAL OF THE APPLICATION #
This application makes it possible to choose a food for which one wishes to obtain a better quality substitute, in order to improve one's diet. It's based on the Open Food Facts database. It's a free and collaborative database referencing food products from all over the world.

The Open Food Facts website (FR): https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/

# GUIDELINES #
* Use continuous integration (we choose Travis here)
* Perform a console line deployment.
* Use Sentry to read all logs and NewRelic to monitor the application.
* Create a Cron task that will update the items retrieved from Open Food Facts once a week.
* Buy a domain name and link it to the server (optional).
* Code written entirely in English: functions, variables, comments, etc.
* Use an agile project methodology to work in project mode.

# DEPLOYMENT #
* PostGreSQL must be installed on the server, with "unaccent" extension.
* Create a "purbeurre" database and a user with password
* Creating a virtual environment with Python 3.8
* Clone the application
* Run the following command to install the necessary libraries :
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
* Create an .env file with these environment variables (replace the xxx with your values):
  - DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings
  - SECRET_KEY=xxx
  - DB_NAME=xxx
  - DB_USER=xxx
  - DB_PASSWORD=xxx
  - DB_HOST=xxx
  - DB_PORT=xxx
* Generate the static files:
  - [python3] manage.py collectstatic
* Create the database tables:
  - [python3] manage.py migrate
* Populating the database:
  - [python3] manage.py import_data
* Run the application locally
  - [python3] manage.py runserver
* Run the tests
  - [python3] manage.py test tests
